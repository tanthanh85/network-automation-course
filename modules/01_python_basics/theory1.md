## 2. Setting Up Your Python Environment

A well-configured Python environment is crucial for efficient development and execution of network automation scripts.

*   **2.1 Python Installation:**
    *   Download the latest stable Python 3 version from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Python 3.x is recommended as Python 2.x is End-of-Life.
    *   During installation (especially on Windows), ensure you check the option to "Add Python to PATH" for easier command-line access.
    *   **Verification:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
        ```bash
        python --version
        ```
        *Expected Output:* `Python 3.x.x` (where `x.x` is your installed version).
        *If you get an error or Python 2.x, try `python3 --version` or ensure Python is correctly added to your system's PATH.*

*   **2.2 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) / Code Editors:**
    *   These tools provide a structured environment for writing, debugging, and managing your Python code.
    *   **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** A popular, lightweight, and highly extensible code editor with excellent Python support via extensions. Recommended for its balance of features and performance.
    *   **PyCharm:** A powerful, full-featured IDE specifically designed for Python development, offering advanced debugging, code analysis, and project management capabilities. Available in Community (free) and Professional editions.
    *   **Sublime Text / Atom:** General-purpose text editors with strong plugin ecosystems that can be configured for Python development.

*   **2.3 Package Manager (`pip`):**
    *   `pip` is Python's standard package installer. It allows you to easily install, upgrade, and manage third-party Python libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
    *   `pip` is typically installed automatically with Python 3.
    *   **Common `pip` Commands:**
        *   Install a package: `pip install <package_name>` (e.g., `pip install netmiko`)
        *   Upgrade a package: `pip install --upgrade <package_name>`
        *   List installed packages: `pip list`
        *   Uninstall a package: `pip uninstall <package_name>`

*   **2.4 Virtual Environments (`venv`):**
    *   Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. This prevents conflicts between projects that might require different versions of the same library.
    *   **Conceptual Diagram:**
        ```
              +-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
              | Global Python     |      | Project A Env     |      | Project B Env     |
              | (Base Installation)|      | (Python + Libs A) |      | (Python + Libs B) |
              +-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
                       |                          |                          |
                       |                          |                          |
                       V                          V                          V
              +-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
              | System-wide libs  |      | Project A Scripts |      | Project B Scripts |
              +-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
        ```
        *Each virtual environment has its own isolated set of installed Python packages, preventing version conflicts.*
    *   **Steps to Use `venv`:**
        1.  **Create:** Navigate to your project directory and run:
            ```bash
            python -m venv my_project_env
            ```
            (Replace `my_project_env` with your desired environment name).
        2.  **Activate:**
            *   **Linux/macOS:**
                ```bash
                source my_project_env/bin/activate
                ```
            *   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
                ```cmd
                my_project_env\Scripts\activate.bat
                ```
            *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
                ```powershell
                .\my_project_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
                ```
            Once activated, your terminal prompt will typically show the environment name (e.g., `(my_project_env) your_user@your_machine:~$`).
        3.  **Install Packages:** While activated, use `pip install <package_name>`. Packages will be installed only in this environment.
        4.  **Deactivate:**
            ```bash
            deactivate
            ```

## 3. Core Python Concepts: Variables, Data Types, Operators

Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for writing any Python program.

*   **3.1 Variables:**
    *   Variables are named storage locations that hold data. They act as containers for values.
    *   Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Python infers it at runtime.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        device_name = "Router1"         # Assigns the string "Router1" to device_name
        device_ip = "192.168.1.1"       # Assigns the string "192.168.1.1" to device_ip
        port_number = 22                # Assigns the integer 22 to port_number
        is_reachable = True             # Assigns the boolean True to is_reachable
        ```

*   **3.2 Common Data Types:**
    Python supports several built-in data types to represent different kinds of information.

    | Data Type    | Description                                       | Example                                  | Network Automation Context                 |
    | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
    | `int`        | Whole numbers (integers)                          | `10`, `200`, `-5`                        | Port numbers, VLAN IDs, interface indices  |
    | `float`      | Decimal numbers (floating-point)                  | `3.14`, `98.6`, `0.5`                    | Latency measurements, bandwidth            |
    | `str`        | Text (sequences of characters), enclosed in single or double quotes | `"hello"`, `'network'`, `"GigabitEthernet0/1"` | Hostnames, IP addresses, commands, configuration snippets |
    | `bool`       | Boolean values: `True` or `False`                 | `True`, `False`                          | Device status (up/down), interface state   |
    | `list`       | Ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items, enclosed in `[]` | `['fa0/1', 'gi0/0']`, `[1, 2, 3]`        | List of interfaces, list of devices to configure |
    | `tuple`      | Ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items, enclosed in `()` | `('admin', 'cisco')`, `(10, 20)`         | Credentials (username, password), fixed device parameters |
    | `dict`       | Unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in `{}` | `{'name': 'R1', 'os': 'IOS'}`            | Device inventory, structured command output, API responses |

    **Code Snippet: Data Type Examples**
    ```python
    # Numbers
    num_devices = 5
    uptime_hours = 123.5

    # Strings
    hostname = "Core-Switch-01"
    config_command = "show running-config"

    # Booleans
    is_connected = True
    has_error = False

    # List (ordered, changeable)
    interfaces = ["GigabitEthernet0/1", "Loopback0", "Vlan1"]
    interfaces.append("TenGigabitEthernet1/1") # Lists can be modified

    # Tuple (ordered, unchangeable)
    credentials = ("admin", "cisco123!")
    # credentials = "new_admin" # This would cause an error

    # Dictionary (unordered, key-value pairs)
    device_info = {
        "hostname": "Edge-Router",
        "ip_address": "10.0.0.1",
        "vendor": "Cisco",
        "os": "IOS-XE"
    }
    print(f"Device: {device_info['hostname']}, IP: {device_info['ip_address']}")
    device_info["location"] = "Data Center A" # Dictionaries can be modified
    ```

*   **3.3 Operators:**
    Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

    *   **Arithmetic Operators:** Perform mathematical calculations.
        *   `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division)
        *   `%` (Modulo - remainder of division)
        *   `**` (Exponentiation)
        *   `//` (Floor Division - division that results in a whole number)
        ```python
        total_ports = 24 + 4 # 28
        bandwidth_gbps = 100 / 8 # 12.5
        remaining_devices = 10 % 3 # 1
        ```

    *   **Comparison Operators:** Compare two values and return a Boolean (`True` or `False`).
        *   `==` (Equal to)
        *   `!=` (Not equal to)
        *   `<` (Less than), `>` (Greater than)
        *   `<=` (Less than or equal to), `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
        ```python
        is_active = (uptime_hours > 100) # True if uptime_hours is greater than 100
        is_cisco = (device_info["vendor"] == "Cisco") # True if vendor is "Cisco"
        ```

    *   **Logical Operators:** Combine conditional statements.
        *   `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true.
        *   `or`: Returns `True` if at least one statement is true.
        *   `not`: Reverses the result; returns `False` if the result is true.
        ```python
        if is_connected and not has_error:
            print("Device is operational.")
        if device_info["os"] == "IOS" or device_info["os"] == "IOS-XE":
            print("Cisco IOS/IOS-XE device.")
        ```

    *   **Assignment Operators:** Assign values to variables.
        *   `=` (Assign)
        *   `+=` (Add and assign), `-=` (Subtract and assign), `*=` (Multiply and assign), etc.
        ```python
        device_count = 0
        device_count += 1 # Same as device_count = device_count + 1
        ```

## 4. Control Flow: Conditionals and Loops

Control flow statements determine the order in which instructions are executed in a program.

*   **4.1 Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`):**
    *   These statements allow your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```python
        if condition1:
            # Code to execute if condition1 is True
        elif condition2: # Optional: 'else if'
            # Code to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
        else:            # Optional: 'otherwise'
            # Code to execute if all preceding conditions are False
        ```
    *   **Flowchart:**
        ```
              +----------------+
              | Start          |
              +----------------+
                      |
                      V
              +----------------+
        No ---| Condition 1?   |--- Yes
        +-----| (e.g., status == 'up') |-----+
        |     +----------------+     |
        V                            V
      +----------------+     +----------------+
      | Condition 2?   |     | Execute Block A|
Yes---| (e.g., status == 'down') |---+   +----------------+
+-----|                |   |
|     +----------------+   |
V                            V
+----------------+     +----------------+
| Execute Block B|     | Execute Block C|
+----------------+     +----------------+
        ```
    *   **Code Example:**
        ```python
        device_status = "up"
        interface_state = "down"

        if device_status == "up":
            print("Device is reachable and active.")
            if interface_state == "down": # Nested conditional
                print("Warning: An important interface is down!")
        elif device_status == "down":
            print("Device is currently unreachable. Investigate connectivity.")
        else:
            print("Device status is unknown. Cannot proceed with automation.")
        ```

*   **4.2 Loops (`for` and `while`):**
    *   Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

    *   **`for` Loop:**
        *   Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers) or other iterable objects.
        *   **Use Case:** Processing a list of devices, iterating through commands, parsing lines from a file.
        *   **Code Example:**
            ```python
            device_list = ["RouterA", "SwitchB", "FirewallC"]
            print("--- Processing Devices ---")
            for device in device_list:
                print(f"Attempting to connect to {device}...")
                # In a real script, network connection logic would go here

            # Iterating through a dictionary's keys, values, or items
            device_details = {"name": "R1", "ip": "192.168.1.1", "os": "IOS"}
            print("\n--- Device Details ---")
            for key, value in device_details.items():
                print(f"{key}: {value}")

            # Using range() for a specific number of iterations
            print("\n--- Sending 3 Ping Requests ---")
            for i in range(3): # This will iterate for i = 0, 1, 2
                print(f"Ping attempt {i + 1}...")
            ```

    *   **`while` Loop:**
        *   Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `True`.
        *   **Use Case:** Retrying a connection until successful, continuous monitoring until a state changes, or processing user input until a specific keyword is entered.
        *   **Code Example:**
            ```python
            import time # Import time module for delays

            retry_count = 0
            max_retries = 5
            is_connected = False

            print("--- Attempting Device Connection ---")
            while not is_connected and retry_count < max_retries:
                retry_count += 1
                print(f"Attempting connection (Attempt {retry_count}/{max_retries})...")
                time.sleep(2) # Simulate a network delay

                # For demonstration, assume connection succeeds on the 3rd attempt
                if retry_count == 3:
                    is_connected = True
                else:
                    print("Connection failed. Retrying...")

            if is_connected:
                print("Successfully connected to device!")
            else:
                print("Failed to connect after multiple retries. Aborting.")
            ```

## 5. Functions: Building Reusable Code

Functions are fundamental to writing organized, efficient, and maintainable Python code.

*   **5.1 Definition:**
    *   A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific, well-defined task.
    *   It allows you to encapsulate a set of instructions and execute them multiple times by simply calling the function name.

*   **5.2 Benefits:**
    *   **Modularity:** Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable, and self-contained units. This makes code easier to understand and reason about.
    *   **Reusability:** Write a piece of code once and use it many times throughout your program or even in different projects. This avoids code duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself principle).
    *   **Readability & Maintainability:** Well-named functions with clear purposes make your code easier for others (and your future self) to read, understand, and modify.
    *   **Debugging:** If an issue arises, you can often pinpoint the problem to a specific function, making troubleshooting much simpler.

*   **5.3 Syntax:**
    ```python
    def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
        """
        Docstring: A string literal used to document a module, function, class, or method.
        It explains what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns.
        """
        # Code block for the function
        # This code will be executed when the function is called
        result = parameter1 + parameter2
        return result # Optional: return a value from the function
    ```
    *   `def`: Keyword to define a function.
    *   `function_name`: A descriptive name for your function.
    *   `parameters`: Variables that receive values when the function is called. They are optional.
    *   `:`: Colon indicates the start of the function's code block.
    *   **Indentation:** All code within the function must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to indicate it belongs to the function.
    *   `return`: Keyword to send a value back from the function to the caller. If no `return` statement is present, the function implicitly returns `None`.

    ```python
    def connect_and_send_commands(device_ip, username, password, commands):
        """
        Simulates connecting to a network device and sending a list of commands.
        In a real scenario, this function would use a library like Netmiko.

        Args:
            device_ip (str): The IP address of the network device.
            username (str): The username for device login.
            password (str): The password for device login.
            commands (list): A list of commands to send to the device.

        Returns:
            str: A status message indicating success or failure.
        """
        print(f"--- Attempting to connect to {device_ip} ---")
        print(f"  Using credentials: {username}/{password}")

        try:
            # Simulate connection success
            if device_ip == "192.168.1.254":
                print("  Connection established successfully.")
                print("  Sending commands:")
                for cmd in commands:
                    print(f"    - {cmd}")
                    # In a real scenario: net_connect.send_command(cmd) or net_connect.send_config_set(cmd)
                return "Configuration successful!"
            else:
                return f"Failed to connect to {device_ip}: Device not found or unreachable (simulated)."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred during connection or command execution: {e}"

    # Example Usage:
    router_ip = "192.168.1.254"
    router_user = "admin"

## 6. Modules and Packages: Organizing Your Code

As your Python projects grow, organizing your code into modules and packages becomes essential for maintainability and collaboration.

*   **6.1 Modules:**
    *   A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) containing Python definitions and statements. It can define functions, classes, and variables.
    *   Modules allow you to logically organize your code and reuse it across different scripts.
    *   **Importing Modules:**
        *   **Import the entire module:**
            ```python
            import math # Imports the built-in math module
            print(math.sqrt(16)) # Access functions using module_name.function_name
            ```
        *   **Import specific objects (functions, classes, variables) from a module:**
            ```python
            from datetime import datetime, timedelta # Imports specific objects from datetime module
            now = datetime.now()
            print(now)
            # You can directly use datetime and timedelta without the 'datetime.' prefix
            ```
        *   **Import with an alias (rename for convenience):**
            ```python
            import os as operating_system # Imports os module and renames it to 'operating_system'
            print(operating_system.getcwd()) # Use the alias
            ```
        *   **Import all objects (generally discouraged in larger projects due to potential name clashes):**
            ```python
            from math import * # Imports all names from math module
            print(sqrt(25)) # Can directly use sqrt()
            ```

*   **6.2 Packages:**
    *   A package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy.
    *   A directory is considered a Python package if it contains a special file named `__init__.py` (which can be empty). This file tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.
    *   Packages provide a structured way to manage larger projects and prevent name collisions between modules.
    *   **Example Package Structure:**
        ```
        my_network_project/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── main.py
        ├── devices/
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── router_config.py  # Module for router-specific configurations
        │   └── switch_monitor.py # Module for switch monitoring functions
        └── utils/
            ├── __init__.py
            └── helpers.py        # Module for general utility functions (e.g., parsing)
        ```
    *   **Importing from Packages:**
        ```python
        # In main.py (or any other module within the project)

        # Import a module from a sub-package
        from devices import router_config
        # Now you can call functions defined in router_config.py like:
        # router_config.apply_template(...)

        # Import a specific function from a module within a sub-package
        from utils.helpers import parse_output
        # Now you can call the function directly:
        # parsed_data = parse_output(raw_text)

        # You can also import the sub-package itself
        # import devices
        # devices.router_config.apply_template(...)
        ```

## 7. Working with Files

File I/O (Input/Output) is a crucial capability for network automation scripts, allowing them to interact with external data sources and store results.

*   **7.1 Purpose in Network Automation:**
    *   **Reading Inputs:** Loading lists of device IPs, credentials, configuration templates (Jinja2), or structured data (JSON, YAML) that define automation tasks.
    *   **Storing Outputs:** Saving configuration backups, collecting operational data (e.g., `show` command outputs), logging automation activities, or storing parsed data for later analysis.

*   **7.2 File Modes:**
    When opening a file, you specify a "mode" to indicate how you intend to interact with it.

    *   `"r"`: **Read** (default). Opens the file for reading. Error if the file does not exist.
    *   `"w"`: **Write**. Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist, or **truncates (empties)** the file if it already exists.
    *   `"a"`: **Append**. Opens the file for appending. Creates a new file if it does not exist. If the file exists, new data is written to the end of the file.
    *   `"x"`: **Exclusive Creation**. Creates a new file, but fails if the file already exists.
    *   `"b"`: **Binary mode**. Used in combination with other modes (e.g., `"rb"`, `"wb"`) for non-text files like images or executables.
    *   `"t"`: **Text mode** (default). Used for text files.

*   **7.3 Best Practice: `with open(...)` Statement:**
    *   The `with` statement is the recommended way to handle file operations in Python. It ensures that the file is automatically closed after its block is exited, even if errors occur. This prevents resource leaks.

*   **7.4 Code Example: Reading from a File**
    *   **`devices.txt` content (create this file in the same directory as your script):**
        ```
        192.168.1.1
        192.168.1.2
        192.168.1.3
        ```
    *   **Python Code (`read_devices.py`):**
        ```python
        print("--- Reading device IPs from devices.txt ---")
        device_ips = []
        try:
            with open("devices.txt", "r") as f:
                for line in f:
                    device_ips.append(line.strip()) # .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace (like newline chars)
            print("Devices found:", device_ips)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("Error: 'devices.txt' not found. Please create it in the same directory.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        ```

*   **7.5 Code Example: Writing to a File**
    *   **Python Code (`write_backup.py`):**
        ```python
        config_backup_data = """
        hostname MyRouter
        interface GigabitEthernet0/0
         ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
         no shutdown
        interface Loopback0
         ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
        """
        backup_filename = "router_config_backup.txt"

        print(f"\n--- Writing configuration backup to {backup_filename} ---")
        try:
            with open(backup_filename, "w") as f: # 'w' mode will create/overwrite the file
                f.write(config_backup_data)
            print(f"Backup saved successfully to {backup_filename}.")
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
        ```

## 8. Introduction to Network Automation Libraries

Python's strength in network automation is largely due to its specialized third-party libraries that abstract away the complexities of network protocols and device interactions.

*   **8.1 Netmiko:**
    *   **Purpose:** A multi-vendor SSH/Telnet library that simplifies connecting to network devices, sending commands, and retrieving output. It handles common challenges like prompting for passwords, handling pagination, and detecting command completion.
    *   **Features:** Supports a wide range of vendors (Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, Juniper Junos, Arista EOS, HP Comware, etc.), allows sending single commands (`send_command`), configuration sets (`send_config_set`), and transferring files.
    *   **Underlying Technology:** Built on top of Paramiko (for SSH) and Telnetlib (for Telnet).
    *   **Conceptual Use:**
        ```python
        # (This is a conceptual example, actual Netmiko requires installation and real device)
        from netmiko import ConnectHandler
        import time

        # Define a dummy device dictionary (replace with your actual device details if you have one)
        dummy_device = {
            "device_type": "cisco_ios",
            "host": "192.168.1.100", # Placeholder IP
            "username": "admin",
            "password": "cisco",
            "secret": "enable_pass" # For enable mode
        }

        try:
            # Simulate connecting (this part would fail without a real device)
            print(f"Attempting to connect to {dummy_device['host']} using Netmiko...")
            # with ConnectHandler(**dummy_device) as net_connect:
            #     net_connect.enable() # Enter enable mode
            #     output = net_connect.send_command("show version")
            #     print("\n--- Simulated 'show version' output ---")
            #     print(output)
            #     config_output = net_connect.send_config_set(["hostname NEW_HOSTNAME", "no logging console"])
            #     print("\n--- Simulated config output ---")
            #     print(config_output)

            print("Netmiko connection and command execution simulated successfully.")
            print("To run this for real, you need a reachable network device and correct credentials.")
            print("Commented out actual Netmiko calls to prevent errors in this lab environment.")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred during Netmiko conceptual usage (expected if no real device): {e}")
        ```

*   **8.2 NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a unified API to interact with different network operating systems. It aims to abstract away vendor-specific CLI commands, allowing you to write more generic automation code.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Getters:** Retrieve structured data (facts, interfaces, BGP neighbors, ARP table, etc.) in a consistent JSON format across vendors.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Load configurations (merge, replace), compare configurations, commit, and rollback.
    *   **Benefits:** Reduces vendor lock-in for automation scripts, making your code more portable.
    *   **Conceptual Use:**
        ```python
        # (This is a conceptual example, actual NAPALM requires installation and real device)
        from napalm import get_network_driver
        import json # For pretty printing JSON output

        print("\n--- Conceptual NAPALM Usage ---")

        # Define a dummy device dictionary for NAPALM
        dummy_napalm_device = {
            "hostname": "192.168.1.101", # Placeholder IP
            "username": "admin",
            "password": "cisco",
            "optional_args": {"secret": "enable"}
        }

        try:
            # Get the appropriate driver (e.g., 'ios', 'junos', 'nxos', 'eos')
            driver = get_network_driver("ios")

            # Simulate connecting and getting facts
            print(f"Attempting to connect to {dummy_napalm_device['hostname']} using NAPALM...")
            # with driver(**dummy_napalm_device) as device:
            #     device.open()
            #     facts = device.get_facts()
            #     print("\n--- Simulated Device Facts (NAPALM) ---")
            #     print(json.dumps(facts, indent=2))
            #     interfaces = device.get_interfaces()
            #     print("\n--- Simulated Interfaces (NAPALM) ---")
            #     print(json.dumps(interfaces, indent=2))
            #     device.close()

            print("NAPALM connection and getter execution simulated successfully.")
            print("To run this for real, you need a reachable network device and correct credentials.")
            print("Commented out actual NAPALM calls to prevent errors in this lab environment.")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred during NAPALM conceptual usage (expected if no real device): {e}")
        ```

*   **8.3 Requests:**
    *   **Purpose:** A popular and easy-to-use HTTP library for making web requests. While not network-specific in the traditional sense (like SSH/Telnet), it's crucial for interacting with modern network devices and controllers that expose REST APIs.
    *   **Use Cases:** Automating tasks on Cisco DNA Center, Meraki Dashboard, Cisco ACI, Arista CloudVision, or any other platform with a RESTful API.
    *   **Conceptual Use:**
        ```python
        # (This is a conceptual example, requires a real API endpoint and key)
        import requests
        import json

        print("\n--- Real API Interaction with Requests (Public Dummy API) ---")

        # This API provides fake data for testing
        # We will get a list of fake 'users'
        users_api_url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

        try:
            print(f"Making GET request to: {users_api_url}")
            response = requests.get(users_api_url)
            response.raise_for_status() # Check for HTTP errors (4xx or 5xx)

            users_data = response.json() # Parse the JSON response

            print(f"Successfully retrieved {len(users_data)} users.")
            print("First 3 users:")
            for i, user in enumerate(users_data[:3]): # Iterate through first 3 users
                print(f"  User {i+1}:")
                print(f"    ID: {user['id']}")
                print(f"    Name: {user['name']}")
                print(f"    Email: {user['email']}")
                print(f"    City: {user['address']['city']}") # Access nested dictionary
                print("-" * 20)

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error during API request: {e}")
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print("Error: Could not decode JSON response from API.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        ```
