# NASP: Module 1 Theory Guide

## Your First Steps with Python for Networking

---

## 1. Introduction: Why Python for Network Automation?

Imagine you have many network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) and you need to perform the same task on all of them, like changing a password, updating a configuration, or collecting status information. Doing this manually for dozens or hundreds of devices is slow, error-prone, and boring!

This is where **Network Automation** comes in. It's about using software to manage and configure network devices automatically. And **Python** is the most popular programming language for network automation today.

**Why Python?**
*   **Easy to Learn:** Python's simple and clear language makes it great for beginners, even if you've never coded before.
*   **Powerful:** It can do a lot, from simple scripts to complex automation platforms.
*   **Lots of Tools:** There are many ready-to-use Python "libraries" (collections of code) specifically designed for talking to network devices and APIs.
*   **Community:** A huge community means lots of help, tutorials, and examples online.

This module will give you the foundational Python skills you need to start your automation journey.

## 2. Setting Up Your Python Environment

Before you can write Python code, you need to set up your computer.

*   **2.1 Python Installation:**
    *   **Download:** Get the latest Python 3 version from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/). (Python 2 is old and no longer supported).
    *   **Installation Steps:**
        *   **Windows:** Run the installer. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation. This makes it easier to run Python from your command prompt.
        *   **macOS:** Python 3 might be pre-installed, or you can install it via Homebrew (`brew install python3`).
        *   **Linux:** Python 3 is usually pre-installed.
    *   **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and type:
        ```bash
        python --version
        ```
        *Expected Output:* `Python 3.x.x` (e.g., `Python 3.10.5`).
        *If `python --version` doesn't work, try `python3 --version` or ensure Python is correctly added to your system's PATH.*

*   **2.2 Code Editor:**
    *   You can write Python code in any text editor, but a "code editor" (like VS Code, PyCharm or Jupyter) makes it much easier. They offer features like:
        *   **Syntax Highlighting:** Colors your code to make it readable.
        *   **Auto-completion:** Suggests code as you type.
        *   **Debugging:** Helps you find and fix errors.
    *   **Recommendation:** **VS Code (Visual Studio Code)** is free, popular, and has excellent Python support. Download it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

*   **2.3 Virtual Environments (`venv`): Keeping Projects Tidy**
    *   Imagine you have two network automation projects. Project A needs an older version of a library, while Project B needs a newer version. If you install them globally, they might conflict!
    *   A **virtual environment** creates an isolated space for each project. It's like a separate "box" for your project's Python and its libraries.
    *   **How to use `venv`:**
        1.  **Create a Project Folder:**
            ```bash
            mkdir my_network_project
            cd my_network_project
            ```
        2.  **Create the Virtual Environment:**
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv_name # 'venv_name' can be anything, 'venv' is common
            ```
        3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
            *   **Linux/macOS:**
                ```bash
                source venv_name/bin/activate
                ```
            *   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
                ```cmd
                venv_name\Scripts\activate.bat
                ```
            *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
                ```powershell
                .\venv_name\Scripts\Activate.ps1
                ```
            *   *You'll see `(venv_name)` at the start of your command prompt, meaning it's active.*
        4.  **Install Libraries:** When the `venv` is active, any `pip install` commands will install libraries only into *this* environment.
            ```bash
            pip install some-library # Installs into venv_name
            ```
        5.  **Deactivate:** When you're done working on the project, simply type:
            ```bash
            deactivate
            ```

## 3. Core Python Concepts: Variables, Data Types, Operators

These are the fundamental building blocks of any Python program.

*   **3.1 Variables:**
    *   Variables are like labeled boxes that hold information. You give them a name, and you can store different kinds of data inside them.
    *   Python is smart: you don't need to tell it what type of data you're storing; it figures it out.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        device_name = "CoreRouter-01" # A variable named 'device_name' holding text
        vlan_id = 100                 # A variable named 'vlan_id' holding a whole number
        is_reachable = True           # A variable named 'is_reachable' holding a True/False value
        ```

*   **3.2 Common Data Types:**
    Python has different types of "boxes" (data types) for different kinds of information.

    | Data Type    | Description                                       | Example                                  | Network Automation Context                 |
    | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
    | `int`        | Whole numbers (integers)                          | `10`, `200`, `-5`                        | Port numbers, VLAN IDs, interface indices  |
    | `float`      | Decimal numbers (floating-point)                  | `3.14`, `98.6`, `0.5`                    | Latency measurements, bandwidth            |
    | `str`        | Text (strings), enclosed in single or double quotes | `"hello"`, `'network'`, `"GigabitEthernet0/1"` | Hostnames, IP addresses, commands, configuration snippets |
    | `bool`       | Boolean values: `True` or `False`                 | `True`, `False`                          | Device status (up/down), interface state   |
    | `list`       | Ordered, changeable collection of items, enclosed in `[]` | `['fa0/1', 'gi0/0']`, `[1, 2, 3]`        | List of interfaces, list of devices to configure |
    | `tuple`      | Ordered, unchangeable collection of items, enclosed in `()` | `('admin', 'cisco')`, `(10, 20)`         | Credentials (username, password), fixed device parameters |
    | `dict`       | Unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in `{}` | `{'name': 'R1', 'os': 'IOS'}`            | Device inventory, structured command output, API responses |

    **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Numbers
    num_devices = 5
    uptime_hours = 123.5

    # Strings
    hostname = "Core-Switch-01"
    config_command = "show running-config"

    # Booleans
    is_connected = True

    # List (ordered, changeable)
    interfaces = ["GigabitEthernet0/1", "Loopback0", "Vlan1"]
    interfaces.append("TenGigabitEthernet1/1") # You can add to a list!

    # Tuple (ordered, unchangeable)
    credentials = ("admin", "cisco123!")
    # You CANNOT do: credentials = "new_admin" - Tuples are fixed!

    # Dictionary (unordered, key-value pairs)
    device_info = {
        "hostname": "Edge-Router",
        "ip_address": "10.0.0.1",
        "vendor": "Cisco",
        "os": "IOS-XE"
    }
    print(f"Device: {device_info['hostname']}, IP: {device_info['ip_address']}")
    device_info["location"] = "Data Center A" # You can add/change dictionary entries
    ```
    **Expected Output (for the `print` statements):**
    ```
    Device: Edge-Router, IP: 10.0.0.1
    ```

*   **3.3 Operators:**
    Operators are symbols that perform actions on variables and values.

    *   **Arithmetic:** `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), `%` (remainder), `**` (power)
        ```python
        total_ports = 24 + 4 # 28
        bandwidth_gbps = 100 / 8 # 12.5
        ```
    *   **Comparison:** `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less or equal), `>=` (greater or equal)
        ```python
        is_active = (uptime_hours > 100) # True if uptime_hours is greater than 100
        is_cisco = (device_info["vendor"] == "Cisco") # True if vendor is "Cisco"
        ```
    *   **Logical:** `and` (both true), `or` (at least one true), `not` (reverse truth)
        ```python
        if is_connected and is_active:
            print("Device is operational.")
        ```
    **Expected Output (for the `if` statement, assuming `is_connected` and `is_active` are True):**
    ```
    Device is operational.
    ```

## 4. Data Representation: JSON, YAML, and XML

Network devices, APIs, and automation tools often exchange data using specific formats. Understanding these is crucial. They are essentially structured ways to represent Python's lists and dictionaries.

*   **4.1 What are they? Why use them?**
    *   These are human-readable (mostly) formats for storing and exchanging structured data.
    *   They allow you to represent complex information (like a device's configuration, a list of interfaces, or API responses) in a way that both humans and computers can understand.
    *   Instead of just plain text, they provide a clear structure (like keys and values, or nested sections).

*   **4.2 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
    *   **Description:** A lightweight data-interchange format. It's very popular because it's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
    *   **Looks like:** Python dictionaries and lists!
    *   **Usage:** Widely used in web APIs (REST APIs), configuration files, and log data.
    *   **Python Module:** `json` (built-in)

    **JSON Example Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "device": "Router1",
      "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
      "interfaces": [
        {"name": "GigabitEthernet0/1", "status": "up"},
        {"name": "Loopback0", "status": "up"}
      ],
      "credentials": {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "cisco"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Python `json` Module Examples:**
    ```python
    import json

    # Python dictionary (data to be converted to JSON)
    device_data_py = {
        "hostname": "CoreRouter",
        "ip": "10.0.0.1",
        "model": "Cisco 4331",
        "interfaces": [
            {"name": "GigabitEthernet0/0", "ip": "10.0.0.1"},
            {"name": "GigabitEthernet0/1", "ip": "10.0.0.2"}
        ]
    }

    # 1. Convert Python Dictionary to JSON String (Serialization)
    json_string = json.dumps(device_data_py, indent=2) # indent=2 for pretty-printing
    print("--- Python Dict to JSON String ---")
    print(json_string)
    print(type(json_string)) # <class 'str'>

    # 2. Convert JSON String to Python Dictionary (Deserialization)
    json_string_from_api = '{"device_id": "SW1", "vlan": 10, "ports": ["Fa0/1", "Fa0/2"]}'
    python_dict = json.loads(json_string_from_api)
    print("\n--- JSON String to Python Dict ---")
    print(python_dict)
    print(type(python_dict)) # <class 'dict'>
    print(f"Device ID: {python_dict['device_id']}, VLAN: {python_dict['vlan']}")

    # 3. Write Python Dictionary to JSON File
    with open("device_info.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(device_data_py, f, indent=2)
    print("\nPython dictionary written to device_info.json")

    # 4. Read JSON File to Python Dictionary
    with open("device_info.json", "r") as f:
        loaded_data = json.load(f)
    print("\n--- JSON File to Python Dict ---")
    print(loaded_data)
    ```
    **Expected Output (console):**
    ```
    --- Python Dict to JSON String ---
    {
      "hostname": "CoreRouter",
      "ip": "10.0.0.1",
      "model": "Cisco 4331",
      "interfaces": [
        {
          "name": "GigabitEthernet0/0",
          "ip": "10.0.0.1"
        },
        {
          "name": "GigabitEthernet0/1",
          "ip": "10.0.0.2"
        }
      ]
    }
    <class 'str'>

    --- JSON String to Python Dict ---
    {'switch_name': 'SW1', 'vlans': 10, 'ports': ['Fa0/1', 'Fa0/2']}
    <class 'dict'>
    Device ID: SW1, VLAN: 10

    Python dictionary written to device_info.json

    --- JSON File to Python Dict ---
    {'hostname': 'CoreRouter', 'ip': '10.0.0.1', 'model': 'Cisco 4331', 'interfaces': [{'name': 'GigabitEthernet0/0', 'ip': '10.0.0.1'}, {'name': 'GigabitEthernet0/1', 'ip': '10.0.0.2'}]}
    ```
    **Expected Content of `device_info.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "hostname": "CoreRouter",
      "ip": "10.0.0.1",
      "model": "Cisco 4331",
      "interfaces": [
        {
          "name": "GigabitEthernet0/0",
          "ip": "10.0.0.1"
        },
        {
          "name": "GigabitEthernet0/1",
          "ip": "10.0.0.2"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

*   **4.3 YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**
    *   **Description:** A human-friendly data serialization standard. It's often preferred for configuration files because its syntax is very clean and easy to read, using indentation to show structure.
    *   **Looks like:** Very clean, uses spaces for indentation.
    *   **Usage:** Popular for configuration files (e.g., Ansible playbooks), data storage.
    *   **Python Library:** `PyYAML` (needs to be installed: `pip install PyYAML`)

    **YAML Example Structure:**
    ```yaml
    # This is a YAML comment
    device: Router1
    ip_address: 192.168.1.1
    interfaces:
      - name: GigabitEthernet0/1
        status: up
      - name: Loopback0
        status: up
    credentials:
      username: admin
      password: cisco
    ```

    **Python `PyYAML` Examples:**
    ```python
    import yaml

    # Python dictionary (data to be converted to YAML)
    network_config_py = {
        "hostname": "BranchRouter",
        "loopbacks": [
            {"id": 0, "ip": "1.1.1.1"},
            {"id": 1, "ip": "2.2.2.2"}
        ],
        "snmp_community": "public",
        "dns_servers": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
    }

    # 1. Convert Python Dictionary to YAML String
    yaml_string = yaml.dump(network_config_py, sort_keys=False, default_flow_style=False)
    print("--- Python Dict to YAML String ---")
    print(yaml_string)
    print(type(yaml_string)) # <class 'str'>

    # 2. Convert YAML String to Python Dictionary
    yaml_string_from_file = """
    device_type: cisco_ios
    host: 192.168.50.1
    username: network_user
    password: mysecurepassword
    """
    python_dict_from_yaml = yaml.safe_load(yaml_string_from_file)
    print("\n--- YAML String to Python Dict ---")
    print(python_dict_from_yaml)
    print(type(python_dict_from_yaml)) # <class 'dict'>
    print(f"Device Type: {python_dict_from_yaml['device_type']}")

    # 3. Write Python Dictionary to YAML File
    with open("network_config.yaml", "w") as f:
        yaml.dump(network_config_py, f, sort_keys=False, default_flow_style=False)
    print("\nPython dictionary written to network_config.yaml")

    # 4. Read YAML File to Python Dictionary
    with open("network_config.yaml", "r") as f:
        loaded_yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    print("\n--- YAML File to Python Dict ---")
    print(loaded_yaml_data)
    ```
    **Expected Output (console):**
    ```
    --- Python Dict to YAML String ---
    hostname: BranchRouter
    loopbacks:
    - id: 0
      ip: 1.1.1.1
    - id: 1
      ip: 2.2.2.2
    snmp_community: public
    dns_servers:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - 8.8.4.4

    <class 'str'>

    --- YAML String to Python Dict ---

    <class 'dict'>
    Device Type: cisco_ios

    Python dictionary written to network_config.yaml

    --- YAML File to Python Dict ---
    {'hostname': 'BranchRouter', 'loopbacks': [{'id': 0, 'ip': '1.1.1.1'}, {'id': 1, 'ip': '2.2.2.2'}], 'snmp_community': 'public', 'dns_servers': ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4']}
    ```
    **Expected Content of `network_config.yaml`:**
    ```yaml
    hostname: BranchRouter
    loopbacks:
    - id: 0
      ip: 1.1.1.1
    - id: 1

    snmp_community: public
    dns_servers:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - 8.8.4.4
    ```

*   **4.4 XML (Extensible Markup Language)**
    *   **Description:** A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It uses tags to define elements.
    *   **Looks like:** HTML, with opening and closing tags.
    *   **Usage:** Older network devices (e.g., some Netconf implementations), SOAP APIs, configuration backups. While less common than JSON/YAML for new APIs, you'll still encounter it.
    *   **Python Library:** `xmltodict` (needs to be installed: `pip install xmltodict`) - This library is great because it converts XML directly to Python dictionaries and vice-versa, making it much easier to work with than raw XML parsing.

    **XML Example Structure:**
    ```xml
    <device>
        <hostname>CoreRouter</hostname>
        <ip_address>10.0.0.1</ip_address>
        <interfaces>
            <interface>
                <name>GigabitEthernet0/0</name>
                <status>up</status>
            </interface>
            <interface>
                <name>Loopback0</name>
                <status>up</status>
            </interface>
        </interfaces>
    </device>
    ```

    **Python `xmltodict` Examples:**
    ```python
    import xmltodict
    import json # For pretty-printing the dict after XML conversion

    # XML String (often from a device or API)
    xml_string_from_device = """
    <router>
        <name>R1</name>
        <interfaces>
            <interface>
                <id>Gi0/0</id>
                <status>up</status>
            </interface>
            <interface>
                <id>Gi0/1</id>
                <status>down</status>
            </interface>
        </interfaces>
        <os>IOS-XE</os>
    </router>
    """

    # 1. Convert XML String to Python Dictionary
    # 'Force_list' ensures that 'interface' is always a list, even if there's only one.
    # This helps avoid errors when iterating.
    python_dict_from_xml = xmltodict.parse(xml_string_from_device, force_list=('interface',))
    print("--- XML String to Python Dict ---")
    print(json.dumps(python_dict_from_xml, indent=2)) # Using json.dumps to pretty-print the dict
    print(type(python_dict_from_xml)) # <class 'dict'>

    # Accessing data from the converted dictionary
    router_name = python_dict_from_xml['router']['name']
    print(f"\nRouter Name: {router_name}")
    print("Interfaces:")
    for iface in python_dict_from_xml['router']['interfaces']['interface']:
        print(f"  - {iface['id']}: {iface['status']}")

    # 2. Convert Python Dictionary to XML String
    python_dict_to_xml = {
        'network_device': {
            'hostname': 'SwitchA',
            'model': 'Cisco 2960',
            'vlans': {
                'vlan': [
                    {'id': 10, 'name': 'DATA'},
                    {'id': 20, 'name': 'VOICE'}
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    
    # 'pretty=True' for human-readable output
    xml_string_from_dict = xmltodict.unparse(python_dict_to_xml, pretty=True)
    print("\n--- Python Dict to XML String ---")
    print(xml_string_from_dict)

## 5. Control Flow: Conditionals and Loops

Control flow statements determine the order in which instructions are executed in a program.

*   **5.1 Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`): Making Decisions**
    *   These statements allow your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        device_status = "up" # Try changing this to "down" or "unknown"

        if device_status == "up":
            print("Device is operational. Proceed with configuration.")
        elif device_status == "down": # 'elif' means 'else if'
            print("Device is down. Investigate connectivity issues.")
        else: # If none of the above conditions are true
            print("Device status is unknown. Manual check required.")
        ```
    **Expected Output (if `device_status` is "up"):**
    ```
    Device is operational. Proceed with configuration.
    ```
    **Expected Output (if `device_status` is "down"):**
    ```
    Device is down. Investigate connectivity issues.
    ```
    **Expected Output (if `device_status` is "unknown"):**
    ```
    Device status is unknown. Manual check required.
    ```

*   **5.2 Loops (`for` and `while`): Repeating Actions**
    *   Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

    *   **`for` Loop:** Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list of devices, characters in a string, or a range of numbers).
        *   **Example:**
            ```python
            device_ips = ["192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.11", "192.168.1.12"]

            print("--- Processing Device IPs ---")
            for ip in device_ips: # For each 'ip' in the 'device_ips' list
                print(f"Attempting to connect to IP: {ip}")
                # In a real script, you'd have Netmiko/NAPALM connection code here
            ```
        **Expected Output:**
        ```
        --- Processing Device IPs ---
        Attempting to connect to IP: 192.168.1.10
        Attempting to connect to IP: 192.168.1.11
        Attempting to connect to IP: 192.168.1.12
        ```

    *   **`while` Loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `True`.
        *   **Example:**
            ```python
            import time # We need this to simulate a delay

            retry_count = 0
            max_retries = 3
            connection_successful = False

            while not connection_successful and retry_count < max_retries:
                retry_count += 1
                print(f"Attempting connection (Attempt {retry_count}/{max_retries})...")
                time.sleep(2) # Simulate waiting for a connection
                # In a real script, you'd try to connect here and set connection_successful
                if retry_count == 2: # Simulate success on the 2nd try
                    connection_successful = True

            if connection_successful:
                print("Successfully connected!")
            else:
                print("Failed to connect after multiple retries.")
            ```
        **Expected Output:**
        ```
        Attempting connection (Attempt 1/3)...
        Attempting connection (Attempt 2/3)...
        Successfully connected!
        ```

## 6. Functions: Building Reusable Code

Functions are like mini-programs within your main program. They let you group code that performs a specific task, so you can reuse it without writing it again.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Reusability:** Write once, use many times.
    *   **Organization:** Makes your code cleaner and easier to understand.
    *   **Easier Debugging:** If there's a problem, you know which function to check.

*   **Example:**
    ```python
    def send_command(device_ip, command):
        """
        This function simulates sending a command to a network device.
        It takes a device IP and a command as input.
        """
        print(f"Connecting to {device_ip}...")
        print(f"Sending command: '{command}'")
        # In a real scenario, this would use a library like Netmiko
        if "show version" in command:
            return "Cisco IOS Software, Version 15.6"
        else:
            return "Command executed successfully."

    # Call the function multiple times
    output1 = send_command("192.168.1.10", "show version")
    print(f"Output for device 1: {output1}")

    output2 = send_command("192.168.1.11", "configure terminal")
    print(f"Output for device 2: {output2}")
    ```
    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    Connecting to 192.168.1.10...
    Sending command: 'show version'
    Output for device 1: Cisco IOS Software, Version 15.6
    Connecting to 192.168.1.11...
    Sending command: 'configure terminal'
    Output for device 2: Command executed successfully.
    ```

## 7. Modules and Packages: Organizing Larger Projects

As your Python scripts grow, you'll want to organize your code into modules and packages.

*   **7.1 Modules:**
    *   A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) that contains Python code (functions, variables, etc.).
    *   You can use code from one module in another using the `import` statement.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        # In a file named 'network_utils.py'
        def ping_device(ip):
            print(f"Pinging {ip}...")
            return True

        # In your main script (e.g., 'main.py')
        import network_utils # Imports the entire module

        if network_utils.ping_device("192.168.1.1"):
            print("Device is reachable.")
        ```
        **Expected Output (if `main.py` is run):**
        ```
        Pinging 192.168.1.1...
        Device is reachable.
        ```

*   **7.2 Packages:**
    *   A package is a way to organize related modules into a directory structure.
    *   A directory becomes a Python package if it contains a special (often empty) file named `__init__.py`.
    *   **Example Structure:**
        ```
        my_network_project/
        ├── main.py
        ├── devices/
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── routers.py
        │   └── switches.py
        └── utils/
            ├── __init__.py
            └── parsers.py
        ```
    *   **Importing from Packages:**
        ```python
        # In main.py
        from devices import routers # Import 'routers.py' module from 'devices' package
        from utils.parsers import parse_output # Import 'parse_output' function from 'parsers.py'

        # routers.configure_router(...)
        # parsed_data = parse_output(...)
        ```

## 8. Working with Files

Your automation scripts will often need to read data from files (like a list of device IPs) or write data to files (like configuration backups or logs).

*   **Opening Files:** Use the `open()` function.
    *   `"r"`: Read mode (default).
    *   `"w"`: Write mode (creates new file or overwrites existing).
    *   `"a"`: Append mode (adds to the end of an existing file).
*   **Best Practice:** Use the `with` statement. It automatically closes the file, even if errors occur.

*   **Example: Reading and Writing:**
    ```python
    # --- Writing to a file ---
    config_data = "hostname MyRouter\ninterface Loopback0\n ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255"
    with open("router_config.txt", "w") as f: # Open in write mode
        f.write(config_data)
    print("Configuration written to router_config.txt")

    # --- Reading from a file ---
    # Assume 'device_list.txt' exists with content:
    # 192.168.1.10
    # 192.168.1.11
    device_ips = []
    with open("device_list.txt", "r") as f: 
        for line in f:
            device_ips.append(line.strip()) # .strip() removes extra spaces/newlines
    print(f"Devices loaded from file: {device_ips}")
    ```
    **Expected Output (console):**
    ```
    Configuration written to router_config.txt
    Devices loaded from file: ['192.168.1.10', '192.168.1.11']
    ```
    **Expected Content of `router_config.txt`:**
    ```
    hostname MyRouter
    interface Loopback0
     ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
    ```

## 9. Introduction to Network Automation Libraries (Brief Overview)

Python's real power for network automation comes from specialized libraries:

*   **Netmiko:**
    *   **What it does:** Simplifies connecting to network devices via SSH/Telnet. You can send commands, get output, and push configurations.
    *   **Think of it as:** A universal remote control for your network devices' command-line interfaces.
*   **NAPALM:**
    *   **What it does:** Provides a common way to interact with different vendors' devices. You write code once, and NAPALM translates it for Cisco, Juniper, etc.
    *   **Think of it as:** A translator that speaks many network device languages.
*   **Requests:**
    *   **What it does:** Makes it easy to send HTTP requests. Essential for talking to network controllers and APIs (like Cisco DNA Center, Meraki).
    *   **Think of it as:** A web browser for your Python scripts.

You'll explore these in more detail in later modules and labs!

## 10. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
-----------------------------------------------

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. These objects are instances of "classes," which serve as blueprints for creating objects. OOP aims to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs.

### Core Concepts of OOP:

1.  Classes: A blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.
    *   _Example:_ A `NetworkDevice` class could define attributes like `hostname`, `ip_address`, `vendor`, and methods like `connect()`, `send_command()`.
2.  Objects: An instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from it.
    *   _Example:_ `router1 = NetworkDevice("R1", "10.0.0.1", "Cisco")` creates an object `router1` from the `NetworkDevice` class.
3.  Attributes: Variables that belong to an object. They represent the state or characteristics of the object.
    *   _Example:_ `router1.hostname` would give "R1".
4.  Methods: Functions that belong to an object. They define the behaviors or actions that an object can perform.
    *   _Example:_ `router1.connect()` would initiate a connection to `router1`.
5.  Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (the class). It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental or unauthorized tampering with the data.
6.  Inheritance: A mechanism that allows a new class (subclass/child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass/parent class). This promotes code reusability.
    *   _Example:_ `IOSRouter` and `NXOSSwitch` could inherit from `NetworkDevice`, inheriting common connection methods but having their own specific configuration methods.
7.  Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to their class.
    *   _Example:_ Both an `IOSRouter` object and an `NXOSSwitch` object might have a `get_version()` method, but the underlying commands they send to retrieve the version might be different.

### OOP in Network Automation Projects:

OOP can be very powerful for large-scale network automation projects, especially when dealing with diverse device types or building complex frameworks. It allows you to:

*   Model Network Devices: Represent devices as objects, making your code more intuitive and aligned with real-world network components.
*   Abstract Complexity: Hide the low-level details of device interaction within methods, exposing a simpler interface to the automation scripts.
*   Promote Reusability: Create base classes for common network device functionalities and extend them for specific vendors or device roles.
*   Improve Maintainability: Changes to how a specific device type is managed can be confined to its class, minimizing impact on other parts of the code.

### Note on OOP for This Course:

While Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental and powerful concept in Python, this introductory course will primarily focus on procedural and functional programming paradigms to keep the learning curve manageable and the examples straightforward. We will use Python's basic data structures (lists, dictionaries), control flow, and functions to build our automation scripts. Understanding OOP is valuable for building more complex, scalable, and maintainable automation frameworks in the future, but it is not a prerequisite for getting started with network automation. Learners are encouraged to explore OOP concepts in Python after completing this course if they wish to advance their programming skills for larger projects.
