*   **Automated Deployment**: Write Python scripts to automate the deployment and configuration of network infrastructure components.
*   **Version Control**: Implement best practices for version control and develop strategies for configuration rollback using IaC principles.

### Module 7: Identification of Workflows Automated using Ansible
*   **Ansible Integration**: Learn to integrate Ansible playbooks with Python scripts for comprehensive automation solutions.
*   **Provisioning & Config Management**: Automate device provisioning, configuration management, and state enforcement.
*   **Workflow Comparison**: Analyze and compare the strengths and use cases of Netmiko-based vs. Ansible-based automation workflows.

### Module 8: Implementation of Security Policies using Python
*   **ACL Automation**: Automate the configuration and management of Access Control Lists (ACLs) across network devices.
*   **Firewall Rules**: Implement and manage firewall rules programmatically.
*   **Security Monitoring**: Develop Python scripts to detect unauthorized devices or configuration deviations that could pose security risks.

### Module 9: Creating Management Console for Cisco Switches
*   **Console Development**: Build a Python-based management console specifically tailored for Cisco switches.
*   **Switch Configuration**: Automate common switch configurations such as VLANs, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and EtherChannel.
*   **Settings Synchronization**: Implement features to synchronize settings and configurations across multiple switches.

### Module 10: Creating Centralized Configuration Management Console for Cisco Routers
*   **Router Management Tool**: Develop a comprehensive, centralized router management tool using Python.
*   **Operational Tasks**: Automate critical operational tasks including log collection, configuration backups, and real-time device status monitoring.
*   **Alerting Integration**: Integrate automated alerting mechanisms via popular communication platforms like Email, Telegram, or Slack to notify administrators of critical events.
